	Initialization Event for softmods (not actual game init)
	
	Create an on-player initialization point for soft mods.
	
	Files which initialize data should register a new event:
	Event.register(Event.def("softmod_init"), function(event) ... end)
	
	Then instead of trying to initialize the softmod on game init, the softmod
	is initialized when the first player is created/joins.
	This lets the softmods be added to an existing map.
